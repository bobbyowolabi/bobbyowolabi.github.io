> "As you learn there will always be new
challenges and new territory to explore. Programmers who refuse to
keep exploring will stagnate, forget their joy, and get bored with
their craft."

### Context
This quote appears in a text about JavaScript, but much more broadly, an introduction to programming ... and the excerpt this quote appears in is just that, a high level explanation of what programming is.  It discusses the difficulties encountered when learning to program and realistic expectations to have during one's pursuit.  This quote appears in the 2nd edition of the text but was removed in the most recent 3rd version.
