title: Sound Basics Part 2 - Properties of Sound
description: In part 2 of an ongoing series exploring sound, we move on from exploring the question "What is Sound" to lay the foundation for a further exploration into the physical properites of sound.  We pose questions such as, "what is ampltidue and frequency and how are they related to our perception of loudness?"  Stay tuned for answers in upcoming posts.

We now have an idea of [what sound is][part-1-what-is-sound]; namely, a disruption in a medium, such as air, that causes molecules to hit each other causing a propagation (wave) of that initial disruption to the ears of a listener.

This is a good foundation for us to build off of, but we usually do not speak of sound like this.  We speak of sound in terms of:

> How loud is it?

> What are the pitches in the melody I'm hearing?

> What is its timbre <sup>[[a]](#what-is-timbre)</sup>?

How does our molecular definition of sound relate to the basic questions above?  

> They are related by the physical properties of how the molecules move.

In the first [part of our series][part-1-what-is-sound], we established the need to separate the notion of hearing from the physical aspects of sound.  As we move on to discuss the physical properties of sound, we will have to continue to maintain this mindset.  The properties of how the molecules move are:

**physical measurements** <sup>[[1]](#music-and-computers)</sup>

The things we hear, such as loudness, pitches and timbre are:

**psychophysical measurements** <sup>[[1]](#music-and-computers)</sup>
<br/><sub>(*measurements of our perception*)</sub>

As we move on to discuss both physical and psychophysical measurements, we'll be sure to distinguish between the two.

We will also discuss things such as:

What is amplitude and frequency?

### Loudness

What is the relationship between loudness, amplitude and frequency?

### Notes
[<a name="what-is-timbre">a</a>] Imagine a note is played on both a guitar and piano ... can you differentiate the instruments based on the sound even though the notes are the same?  Sure you can, that is because their timbre is different.  The timbre of the sound is its quality, the thing that makes it different from other sounds <sup>[[2]](#cook-adruino-music)</sup>.
