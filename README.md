## Citation Methodology

### Markdown Citation Strategy
1. **Define URLs at the End of the Markdown File**

   This allows for the body of the markdown to be free of long URLs thus increasing readability.
   
   *Inline:* `I found the [online app][id-link] to be extremely helpful.`
   
   *End of File:* `id-link: URL`

1. **Use Anchors to Provide Context / Additional Information**

   This is very much in the style of the "Notes" section at the end of [Graham's essays](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html)
   
   *Inline:* `Using comments in the body of your code should be avoided; only comment your public interfaces. [[id]](#id-note)`
   
   *End of File:* `[<a name="id-note">id</a>] This is a subject that people often disagree on ...`

1. **Use Anchors to Provide Citations**

   Provide citation of sources such as blog posts, videos, articles, etc.      
   
   *Inline:* `The author states that test driven development is the only approach that guarantees a comprehensive test suite <sup>[[id]](#id-citation)</sup>`
   
   *End of File:* `[<a name="id-citation">id</a>] Doe, John. "Thoughts on Testings." Blog post. The Blog of John. 29 Sept. 2016. Web. 3 Apr. 2017. <http://theblogofjohhn.com/2016/09/thoughts-on-testing.html>.`
