Learning about sound can be somewhat abstract.  As we learned in the [first part of this series][part-1-what-is-sound], the movement of an object causes a "chain-like" sequence of collisons of air molecules that eventually reaches our ears.  Our body has a way of interpreting this event as sound to us.

Because we can't see these air molecules it can be difficult to relate to them in a tangible way.  Some natural questions arise such as:

> How many air molecules are around us?

> What does this look like visually; are they tightly packed?

Arthur C Ludwig Sr. gives tangible numbers in his write up entitled "Music and Sound Waves."  Ludwig has a music listening room that he designed that is 266 square feet and 8 feet high.  

How many air molecules are in the room?
**1.6 x 10<sup>27</sup>**

That is 16 followed by 26 zeros!

How much do they weigh?
160 pounds!

How close together are the molecules?
Ludwig provides some food for thought; here is a simulated image of <sup>1/2</sup> of 1 millionth of an inch:

Ludwig states that the diameter of of a human hair is 6000 times larger than the cube in the above image.

Let's say you are in a 266 sq. ft. room listening.
