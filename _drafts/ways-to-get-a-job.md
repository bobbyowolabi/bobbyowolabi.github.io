I, like many, have applied to many jobs online over the years.  I like many, have had my applications go into the abyss without so much as a reply.  Not too long ago, I relized something.  Every professional work position I've held has been the result of some kind of referral with the exception of one.  The one position I "applied" for was only possible because of my introduction into the industry by the first position I had.

Some time ago, I came across the idea that there are different methods; or rather, doors to get into a job.  Here is my take on it.

The Front Door


The Back Door

Having connections in itself isn't enough.  Be good.
Dr. Coughlin said there are three things when loooking for someone to play with:
# Reliable, On Time
# Proficient & Skilled
# Pleasant to WOrk With (Not a jerk)
Having at least 2 of the 3 makes the person viable.  In software, replace being Being Good with writing clean resuable code, Being Pleasant 
If you are looking for a startup - maybe clean reusable code isn't necessary, you need a hacker.

Being prolific gets you opportunities
