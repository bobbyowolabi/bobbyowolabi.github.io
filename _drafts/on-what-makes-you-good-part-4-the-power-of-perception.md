Imagine an engineer working in an organization where their colleagues generally do not think they are very good.  Internally, people roll their eyes when they have to help them.  People feel like they seem to be missing "something".

Now, imagine an engineer working in an organization and thriving.  They are thought of as sharp, a high value contributor and good teammate.

What if I told you that these engineers are the same person ... How could this be?

It may seem odd but it is indeed possible for the same engineer to have a vastly different perceptions <sup>[[a]](#definition-of-terms)</sup> from others in different environments and situations.

Two options that come to mind is either the perception is true and derserved or it is false and was unfairly attributed to an individual.  It is tempting to think that these are the only two explanations possible, and technically; yes, a statement is either true or false <sup>[[b]](#paradox)</sup>.  However, there is some room for more nuisance here ... a statement could be true at a given point in time and untrue at another point in time.  In the context of perception, there are many factors that could affect a given attributed perception:
* Timing
* Fit of Environment For the Subject's Strengths & Personality
* Opportunity

### Professional Sports ... The Perfect Illustration of the Power of Perception
Professional sports illustrates the phenomenom of the power of perception perfectly because it controls for one factor ... skill.  In order to work in professional athletics, you have to have a high level of skill.  Despite being skilled, fans and analysts often attribute some atheletes as "good" and "bad".

(The example of Andrew Wiggins)
