We have all seen them ... the engineer's engineer ... the all-star ... that individual who is just so good at what they do best ... the complete package.

Observing greatness can unfortunely bring out our insecurities and self-doubt.  We can process these emotions and put them in their proper place by going through the following reflective exercise.


> **_What Are You Observing?_**
> 
> **_How Do You Validate It?_**
>
> **_What Is Your Response?_**


### What Are You Observing?
When we observe individuals operating at a high level, we must realize that actually what we are observing is an individual operating from their [genius zone][genius-zone].  The reason that this realization is so important is ...

> #### Everyone Has a Genius Zone!

This is so curcial to grasp.  Once you get this, it is easier to stop comparing yourself to others.  Also, if you do accept the above statement, then the implication is clear ...

> #### You Have a Genius Zone Too!

In [part 2 of this series][strengths], we talked through examples of strengths.  Another way to classify what we are observing in these situations is that we are observing one or more strengths on display that comprise that individual's genius zone.

Realizing what you are observing and putting it in its proper place is key in maintain a healthy mindset.  This realization also makes it clear that you too are someone that others can marvel at if you just focus on your strenghs and showcasing your genius zone.



### Choose How to Respond
In the first blog post I ever published, I wrote the following:

> When we observe others operating from their genius zone, we should choose to react positively with admiration, motivation and curiosity; rather than, intimidation and self-doubt. We are all created uniquely and that is something we should embrace.

Quote my first blog post on how to repond.

### Recognize the Greatness of Others



### Case Study: How Chris Botti Responded to Wynton
When Chris Botti was in New York went in really was killing it at the same time and body knew that he had to do something different because he couldn't do what Winton was doing better than him.

Include link to my post quote post on this (might need to be future dated.)
