> When I first moved to New York it was maybe about a year, year and a half after the whole Wynton Marsalis explosion onto the scene.  And somehow I thought to myself, and in hindsight it was the proper way to look at things, that Wynton, by his incredible immense talent, was setting up basically a glass ceiling, and no one's going to penetrate that glass ceiling doing Wynton.
