#### The Talent Myth

The blessing is not in the talent but in the desire to practice and work and the hunger for the end product.

The myth of talent.  We look at people who are good and do things effortless and don't realize how much work was put in to get to that point.  	

Talent is a myth … rather innate expert talent is a myth. Individuals have to work very hard to be “talented”. Since this work / practice is often done in private, observers often assume the person is “just talented”.
