Some people like the Matrix black white green profile scheme.

Or maybe some just like the standard black and white.

But I like the novel profile from Mac terminal.

 After the prompting of some colleagues a few years ago, I started using [iTerm2][iTerm2]. When I switched over to iTerm2, there were no profiles to choose from. So I decided to create a new profile based off of the Mac terminal novel profile.

Here is the import file [[download]][download].

Itâ€™s almost as I want it however I would like to have different colors in the prompt. It appears that you may have to update the [PS1][PS1] environment variable.
