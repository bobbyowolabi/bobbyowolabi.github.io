Some people like the default Matrix black white green profile scheme.

Or maybe some just like the standard Black on white.

 but I like the novel profile from Mac terminal that I came across some years ago and haven't looked back. After the prompting of some colleagues a few years ago, I started using iTerm2. When I switched over to iTerm2, there were no profiles to choose from. So I decided to create a new profile based off of the Mac terminal novel profile.

Here is the import file [[download]][download].

Itâ€™s almost as I wants it however I would like to have different colors in the prompt. It appears that you have to update the [PS1][PS1] environment variable.
