## Converting Sound to Digital

### Modeling / Describing Sound

#### What is a Sinusoidal Waveform?


Two main componets describe a sine wave:

Frequency and amplitude.  These characteristics are decrypted by the human ear to form a sound.


Two main a


How does this


A vibration can be modeled by sinusoidal waveforms.  This i the means in which we physically and technically describe sound [kalenzaga-shazam].


When we see a sine graph


Play Ge Wang’s Ted Talk where he makes a program to play random tones.


Pure tones don’t exist naturally but every sound in the world is the sum of a multple of pure tones at different amplitudes. [kalenzaga-shazam].


### Sampling 

"A Sample is esstially a measurement of the amplitude of a sound at a point in time" (music-and-computers-1.2)

The act of capturing an amplitude over time 


Rate

44100 - every second the sound signal is sampled (measured) 44,100 times [audio-programmer-beginning-tutorial]





Bit Depth

16




## Converting Digital Back to Sound

Speakers

The sine wave is an instruction manual for how your speaker needs to move to recreate the sound.  Literally, it’s how the cone in the speaker needs to move back and forth to recreate the sound [audio-programmer-beginning-tutorial]. 



## Terms to Define

Analog

Fourier Transform

Harmonics

Sine Wave

Base Sine Wave
