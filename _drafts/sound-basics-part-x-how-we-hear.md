## Hearing Sound

The analysis of sound is performed by looking at its fourier transform with is a mathematical thing.  Our ears perform a similar transform with its structure [Newmarch].

Sounds heard by the ear correspond to sine waves.  Harmonics correspond to sine waves with a frequency that is a multiple of the base sine wave [Newmarch].


When you hear sound, it is vibrations of your ear drum.  What causes the vibration of your ear drum?  Air molecules hitting your eardrum cause this vibration.  When the moves object (blowing into a saxophone, piano key, leaves in the wind, guitar string plucked) the surrounding air molecules are disturbed.  What results are air molecules rushing to your eardrum that is waiting to vibrate [music-and-computers].


Air molecules must be able to travel far and wide huh?  I can hear the keys being pressed as I type these words from quite a distance away.


Amplitude is just one characteristic of sound


Frequency - the rate at which the air pressure fluctuates [music-and-computers]


Analogy for the eardrum - children jumping on a trampoline.The trampoline is the eardrum, the children are air molecules.

## Your Eardrum as a Function

Sound can be described as a function [music-and-computers].

Input = the time elapsed since the sound was initiated.

Function = how far and in what direction your eardrum moved.

In other words, time is the input, amplitude/pressure is the output [music-and-computers].

## How Our Ears Work

Sound waves (air molecules) reach out ears, their first stop is the eardrum.
