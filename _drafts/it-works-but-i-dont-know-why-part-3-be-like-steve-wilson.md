### Accept That You Might Not Understand Everything
_(Listen to Steve Wilson)_

(TODO: Dig up the interview and get quotation)

(Tie back to intro where I said: more on that later)

Do you need to understand each and every abtraction?  No.  And this is where I slightly diverge from Buchheit.  I use an anology of a common debate in the NBA corners to explain.

Elite players in the NBA are often put into two groups, allstars and superstars.  An allstar is exactly how it sounds, someone who makes the Allstar and is generally considered an excellent player.  However, there is another higher level

Abstractions and their interfaces are made to make our lives easier.  That's why we are able to try a car and not have to understand all of the various reactions, processes and engineering that occur to make it possible.
