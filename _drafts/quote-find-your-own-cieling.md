### Quote
> When I first moved to New York it was maybe about a year, year and a half after the whole Wynton Marsalis explosion onto the scene.  And somehow I thought to myself, and in hindsight it was the proper way to look at things, that Wynton, by his incredible immense talent, was setting up basically a glass ceiling, and no one's going to penetrate that glass ceiling doing Wynton.  You know, like trying to outdo Wynton.   
>
> So you have now like a long litany of people that are following in Wynton's footsteps which is great you know.  But if you want to like penetrate, you have your own kind of sense of self ... you better go over here and find your own ceiling you know something along those lines you know.  
> 
> So I thought to myself I wanted to release like a very straight ahead purest jazz record where I'm playing you know 15 courses of "All the Things You Are" or something I'm never going to do it like Wynton so don't (try).<sup>[[a]](#transcription-disclaimer)</sup>
