A lot of times when sound is described, a graph of a sound wave is shown.  The sine function is discussed … wasn’t that about angles of a triangle?  We are told sound is simply changes in pressure.  This all is somehow represented in digital form as 0s and 1s.  What does all of this mean?  How can looking at a sine graph help me understand and describe the sound of a saxophone versus a laughing baby?  I want to present these concepts through the eyes of a true beginner.  I hope to achieve this by asking questions of a beginner.

### What is Sound?
In attempting to understand sound, it’s important to separate ourselves from the experience of hearing because it is different from what sound is at it’s core.  But why would I want to put aside the notion of hearing?  That seems pretty important in understanding sound.  The reason for this distinction is that the term "sound", in English, interchangeably refers to two things <sup>[[1]](#communication-acoustics)</sup>:
1. The physical phenonenom
1. The perception

Our hearing of sound is merely an interpretation our body performs for us of a physical event.  We often call these physical events signals.  At a high level, the following occurs <sup>[[2]](#wiki-perception)</sup>:
1. Our ears receive information (signals)
1. Our body interprets this information (our nervous system) 
1. Our senses are stimulated (we hear it via our sensory system)

> *What are the signals our ears received?*

> [If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?][tree-in-forest-sound]

I hope that through our exploration of this topic, we’ll be able to provide more insight into the questions above.

### What Comprises Sound?
Sound Involves Three Actors <sup>[[3]](#music-and-computers)</sup>:
1. An Object
1. Medium
1. Listener

At its core, this boils down to physics and perception <sup>[[3]](#music-and-computers)</sup>.  The first two things, an object & medium are where the physics occurs; the listener is where the perception occurs <sup>[[3]](#music-and-computers)</sup>. 

The Interaction of the Actors Produces Sound <sup>[[3]](#music-and-computers)</sup>:
1. The Movement of an Object
1. The Transmission of the Result of the Movement Through a Medium
1. A Listener Perceives the Transmission of the Movement as Sound

> “All things that make sound move, and in some very metaphysical sense, all things that move (if they don’t move too slowly or too quickly) make sound.” <sup>[[3]](#music-and-computers)</sup>

### The Production of Sound
#### What is the Result of the Movement That We Are Hearing?
Another way to put it is a question we asked earlier, "What are the signals our ears are receiving?"  Before diving right into the result of the movement, let’s start at the molecular level and work our way back up.

There are 3 different phases of matter: 
1. Solids
1. Liquids
1. Gases

Matter, for the purposes of our discussion, is made up of atoms that bond together to form molecules.  
##### Solids
Solids have their molecules tightly packed together.  They keep their shape and not much gets through them. <sup>[[4]](#thompson-mike)</sup>  
##### Liquids
Liquids have their molecules spaced further apart.  Things can move through them but there is some resistance.  Then we have gases. <sup>[[4]](#thompson-mike)</sup>
##### Gases
Gases have molecules that are relatively far apart.  Objects, including us, can easily move through this medium <sup>[[4]](#thompson-mike)</sup>.  It is this movement that results in the production of sound.  Air is comprised of invisible gases that are all around us.  It is made up of certain molecules mainly nitrogen and oxygen.

Let’s get back to our original question, what is this “result of the movement” that we are hearing?  Focusing on the medium of air, the result of the movement we hear are air molecules hitting each other.  How do these air molecules hitting each other arrive to my ear so I can perceive it as sound?

#### How Do Colliding Air Molecules Arrive to Our Ear?
As an object moves, it pushes and pulls at the surrounding air thus causing the air molecules to indeed hit each other, producing something called pressure.  The physical act of the molecules hitting each other is not pressure, but rather, the force that is exerted when they collide with themselves and other objects is what we call pressure. <sup>[[5]](#ucar-what-is-air)</sup>

Not only do the air molecules hit each other producing pressure, but they also produce a wave.  It is through this wave that they arrive at our ears.

##### Sound Waves
A wave like this?

Sort of.  

The following is a clip from the Khan Academy and gives a good illustration of how the air molecules interact when sound is produced:
<iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-_xZZt99MzY?start=07&end=13" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

As seen in the video, this disturbance <sup>[[5]](#waters)</sup> in the air causes the molecules move back and forth and hit other molecules that move back and forth causing a transmission of the initial pressure through the air to arrive to the ears of a listener.  It is this forward and backwards movement of the pressure towards a listener’s ear is described as a wave <sup>[[7]](#computerphile-digital-audio)</sup>.  

[Professor Dan Russell][professor-russell] created an animation that illustrates this wave movement quite well <sup>[[8]](#russell-particle-motion)</sup>:

<img src="http://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/Demos/waves/Lwave-Red-2.gif" width="600" alt="animation showing particle motion for a longitudinal pressure wave highlighting the difference between particle motion and wave propagation.">

As seen in Russell's animation, the molecules themselves don’t actually travel with the sound <sup>[[9]](#wiki-sound)</sup> but merely transport it a short distance to a neighboring molecule.  It’s this transport at a higher level in terms of groups of molecules that comprise the physical phenomenon of a wave.

### Conclusion
What are the signals our ears received?



Are there mediums that cannot transmit waves?
Yes, in space.
(There are some illustrations at http://www.passmyexams.co.uk/GCSE/physics/sound-waves.html)


There are different physical signals around us, one of them is sound.  It is a vibration that propagates through a medium and can be decrypted by our ears.  Light is also a vibration, but we can’t hear it because our ears weren’t designed to do so.  Our eyes were designed to interpret that vibration [kalenzaga-shazam].  Human ears can hear pure tones from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz [kalenzaga-shazam], while light is composed of sine waves from 4 x 10^14 Hz to 7.9 10^14 Hz.



How is it that we “hear” this information?


We can now answer the question ["If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"][tree-in-forest-sound].  If we are referring to sound as a physical phenomenon; then yes, the tree falling will cause a physical sound event that could be analyzed and recorded <sup>[[1]](#communication-acoustics)</sup>.  If we are referring to sound in terms of perception; then no, there is no listener around to actually hear the event <sup>[[1]](#communication-acoustics).
