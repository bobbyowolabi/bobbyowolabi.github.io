When I was in undergrad, I wrote a research paper, “[Composing Music on Paper and Computers][undergrad-paper] <sup>[[a]](#tweet-on-paper)</sup>.”

During that time I came across the field of computer music. Give a one sentence description on what computer music is. I saw the work of Rodger dannenberg and thought to myself this is what I'm supposed to do. someone working in computer science who actively plays improvisational music but is a Carnegie Mellon computer science Professor by day. I started to look at figures like him and others and I thought that I needed to combine my love for music with my skill in computer science.  I considered getting a Phd in computer science with this as a focus.

This is an idea that I've come back to every now and then over the years. This was my idea when I attended the audio developers conference back in 2017 and also wrote my post on audio programming. I was looking for a path to combine music with software development.

Back in 2014 oh, I cut back my full time work hours in order to go back to school to study music. It's something that I always wanted to do. I did that for about a year-and-a-half and once I got in the groove oh, I was generally happy. The balance I enjoyed need coming into the office a lot easier. towards the end when I stopped it started to get difficult and harder to justify internally.

 combining two fields works for some people. but it's not something you have to do. you can have your profession and you can have a hobby or interest. they don't have to intersect.  I no longer actively try to combine both fields.  You don't need to put pressure on yourself to mnakje it happen.

Quote from Justine Musk. In order to become a billionaire you need some master 2 fields.





### Notes

[<a name="tweet-on-paper">a</a>] I published a tweet on this paper a little while back:
