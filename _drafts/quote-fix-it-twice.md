> “It also means that whenever I get a support request, I make sure to Fix It Twice: Once to fix the issue for the customer, and another time in the code, documentation or UI to make sure that I don't ever see another support request for it. So as time goes on, there are fewer things that can interrupt my Days Off. (Days Off being defined as days where the sun is out or the kids of off school and I don't need a rest day from climbing or surfing, so hey, let's polish the product a bit).”

# Context
Jason Kester has a business that supports the type of lifestyle that he desires; one where his vacation time is not limited but also where he can scratch his programmer itch.  Kester does not use this term, but ["lifestlye business"][lifestyle-business] might be appropriate to describe this.  He did not achieve this career overnight.  In the post, "How I built a business that lets me live on the beach full time," Kester goes through the various stages in his career that led him to this point.  The above quote comes towards the end of his post when he is talking about providing support to his online business.  "Fixing it Twice" is his way of automating solutions to support requests so he doesn't have to deal with them in the future.
