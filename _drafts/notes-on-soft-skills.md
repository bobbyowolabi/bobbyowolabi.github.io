The following are notes I took after reading the 

# Business Mindset
Think of career as a business (and all that entails, how to offer better services, specialize, your clients)
How do you look for new clients?  How do you spread the word about your services?  How do you get customers to come and buy your services?  How do you differentiate yourself from others offering the same skills?

# Goals & Career
Don’t follow the path that has been laid out for you.  Actually sit down and think about where you would like to go.  Imagine setting out to sail in a boat.  You could go out aimlessly and hope that you arrive at a good place or you could have a destination in mind and actual go for it.
## Big Goal
What do you ultimately want to do in your career? (Manager, executive, own company, independent consultant, entrepreneur, etc).  Where would you like to see yourself in 5-10 years?  It’s important to make this goal so that you can make smaller goals that can lead you to this destination.

## Smaller Goals
Once you have your big goal, you can start to make small goals that will eventually move you forward in the direction of your bigger goals.

Break down into months weeks, days.

## Track
Periodically track your goals so you can see if you are on track.  Set up regular intervals.
Visualize
Write down your major goals where you can see it each day to remind you of what you’re striving for.

# Cracking the Interview
It’s best to pinpoint a company then try to make contacts within it (commenting on blog posts, meetups, respond to twitter posts, etc).  Make a list of companies your’d like to work for and a plan to meet at least one person who works there.  Find a local user group and introduce yourself to as many people as possible.

# Specialization
It’s important to be able to answer “what kind of developer are you?”  Would you go to a doctor or lawyer without knowing their specialty? 

# Freelancing
Build clientele over time
This allows you to get to the point where you 

The best way to get clients is through inbound marketing.  This is getting clients to come to you instead of you to them by offering something of value for free.
A blog is a great example of this.

You can do inbound marketing by creating content for in the available mediums (webinars, writing books, speaking at conferences, running own podcast).
Rate

## Setting Your Rate
Generally it is 2x what you made while you were working full time, but that is not how you set it.
You charge what the market will allow you to charge.  Inbound marketing helps with this because it helps your reputation.

The more people are coming to you for your services, the more you can charge.
Don't treat your services as a commodity and bid with other developers with much lower income expectations.  In this case, the market will push the buyer to go with the cheapest option.
Instead, base your services on what you can save your client or how you can increase their business.

What would it for their staff or someone without the same expertise to implement.
If you have never had a client tell you that your rate is too high, then raise it.  Keep raising it until you start getting nos.

# Creating Your First Product
Your audience will share their problems with you.  Build products around the problems they share.  Even before you build something, you can test out the premise by allowing “pre-ordering” at a discounted price and see if there is interest.

# Resume
Don’t write it.

Gather all of the necessary and accurate information you can and give it to a professional to present it in a fantastic way.

# Marketing
It’s simply connecting people who want what you have to offer with you.  It's not a bad thing.

The right way to market is to provide value to others.

Look at how Hanselman does it: speaking engagements, podcasts

Problem: We are actually marketing ourselves all the time, it just that most aren’t doing it consciously
Result: We often let other people and circumstances define us and our message

Marketing is about learning how to control that message.

1. Marketing starts with a personal brand, something that you represent.

	a. Need to be conscious about who you want to be and how to present that image to the world. You want to create a sense of familiarity when someone is exposed to you or something you’ve created multiple times.

1. Choose Medium to Convey Brand / Message

	a. Blog is one of the most basic ones where you have ultimate control.

	b. Be Everywhere Strategy

	Derived from:
	https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/passive-income-101/
	Be everywhere you can in the space you’re trying to market to
	Several Options:
	Blog Post		Your own or guest posts on other people’s blog
	Podcast		your own or be interviewed on an existing podcast
	Videos			create topical video or screencasts and tutorials on 
	Youtube
	Magazine Articles	write an article for a software development magazine
	Books			Write a book, or self-publish
	Code Camps		Most code camps will allow anyone to speak
	Conferences		A great way to network and even better if you can speak 
	there

This all depends on your ability to bring value to others.

Come up with at least 20 Blog Posts for your new blog and and make a schedule for creating content.
Brand
A logo is just a visual reminder of the brand but not actually the brand itself.

A brand is a set of expectations about a product or service.

Brand:
A Message
Consistency
Consistency in the message and how it is delivered
Visual
Repeated Exposure
People need to see your brand multiple times so that your brand invokes who you are and what you represent.  Seeing it only once does nothing for that aim.
You do this by blogging, wiring articles, speaking, creating videos, podcasting or any other medium you can to get your name out there.

Step 1: Define your message
What do you want to represent?  You can’t be all things to all people.
What is your brand about?  What are you about?  What Feelings Do You Want to Invoke?

Step 2: Pick a Niche
Pick a niche, the more specific the better.
It can be be what you're passionate about, but its better to make it a strategic decision.  What advantage do you have that you can exploit through a specific niche?
Build your brand around this niche.

Step 3: Create a Tagline
One or two sentences. (ex: Making the complex simple)
What is it that uniquely defines you?  What can someone expect of you?

Step 4: Create an elevator pitch
In your elevator pitch you want to clearly communicate what it is that you do and the unique value you bring.
This will make sure that you are consistent with your branding efforts.

Step 5: Create Visuals
Only after you've figured out the core of your brand is it time to create visuals.

Actions:

Make a list of some of the popular brands you're familiar with.  Pick one or two to study in depth.  What is their message?  How do they use their logo and other visual elements to convey it?
Brainstorm a list of niche ideas for your own personal brand.  Come up with at least 10 to 15 ideas and then narrow down the list to your top 2 or 3.  Try to come up with one that you'll use for your personal brand.

Blog
Can bring your clients to you (inbound marketing)

With enough traffic, you can use it as a platform to sell your own product.  As you learn more about your audience, you can build a product around their interests and convert that traffic directly into customers.

Brings reputation in the industry if blog is successful

Improves your communication skills

The way to be successful is to blog alot! (Or rather consistency)
Every single day would be great, but it doesn't have to be like that.  Once a week is fine (at least).

The content should also be quality (people will subscribe rss, or bookmark, or put backlinks, basically stuff that people will want to share)

Just writing good content, consistently, will easily put you in the top %1 of developers in terms of marketing.
Getting Traffic
Comment on other blogs - write meaningful comments and link back to your blog, make sure to add value to the conversation, not spam

Write a few comments on different blogs each day and over time you'll start to see more traffic.  The higher quality of your comments, the more traffic you'll get

You can write a blog post as a response to someone else's post

Share your blog posts in your social media networks

Put a link to your blog at the bottom of your email signature and anywhere you have a profile online.

Make it easy to share your content so that others will spread it.

For the brave, submit your posts to reddit.com or hackernews

Commit to keeping your blog updated for a year.  That's usually when people start to get results.



Add Value to Others
Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value (Albert Einstein).

Your blog cannot just serve your own interests and not add value to others. People want to hear about how you can help them be successful.

"If you help people get what they want, you will get what you want" (Zig Ziglar)
Give People What They Want
Most people don't know what they want, it's up to you to figure it out for them.  Most people know it when they see it.

Go out and see what people are interested in.  What topics are being talked about in forums related to your niche?  What trends are you seeing in the industry as a whole?  What fears do people have and how can you address them?

The content you produce should be squarely aimed at providing value in the areas you identify from your research.  You might be interested in something, but if your target audience isn't, then it won't do you much good.
Give Away 90% Of What You Do For Freelancing
Gives people a chance to try out your content without having to invest any money first.

Free content is much more shareable than paid content.

It's a marketing investment for the future

Solve problems they have and carry this forward in whatever medium you use to market yourself

TEACHING YOURSELF
Learn through play, experimentation and teaching what you learned to someone else.
Read as much to get started and start experimenting.
10 Step Process
Reading a book cover to cover and then experimenting results in a very slow pace of learning
Clearly define exactly what I needed while ignoring any additional information that wasn't required to meet my goal.
3 Things Needed to Learn to know to Learn a new Technology
1. How to get started - how is needed to get started using whatever was being learned.
2. The breadth of the subject - how big, what can be done with it?
3. The Basics - basic use cases and the most common things I learn.  What is the 20% that would cover 80% of daily usage.
10 Step System:
10. Teach
9. Learn enough to do something useful
8. Play around
7. Learn enough to get started
6. Filter resources
5. Create a Learning Plan
4. Find Resources
3. Define success
2. Determine scope
1. Get the big picture
LDLT - Learn Do Learn Teach (7-10) are repeated for each module in learning plan.
Steps 1-6 are done once
STEPS 1-6:
HEALTH
Make a committment to your health
Setting Your Fitness Criteria
Pick a Specific Goal
It's hard to achieve multiple fitness goals because they are often in conflict with each.
Looising fat requires a calorie deficit while gaining muscle requires a calorie surplus
What are my goals
I'd like to loose weight to be 190lbs; 180lbs would be amazing and put me back in pre and early college years.
Loose fat
I'd like to gain strength (squat a certain weight and bench a certain weight; and be able to do a certain number of pullups)
I'd like to be able to run a 8 minute mile, 7 minute mile, 6 minute mile
I'd like to revisit basketball (dribble with my left hand, learn how to shoot, do exercises that prevent injury, people who play basketball, don't tend to continue to play basketball)
Create Milestones
Don't say I'd like to loose 30lbs, that's too big, but rather, I'd like to loose 2lbs every 2 weeks. Make smaller goals.
Weight yourself everyday, but only use a weekly measurement to chart your progress duee to the various fluctuations that occur.
Once you reach a goal, tapper back to normal living, somewhere between the program and where you were before.

Loosing weight
If you want to loose a pound of fat, you have to burn 3500 more calories than you eat
I want to loose 35 lbs.
I'd like to loose 2lbs every two weeks
I can ensure I have a calorie deficit for the first two weeks

Calories Consumed
Count your calories, keep to simple foods to make it easy, plan for a 10% margin of error, much higher if you are at a restaurant
Calories Burned
2 Metrics
BMR (Wight, High, age, gender) -> value
BMR (213, 6'0", 32, male) = 2089
Harris Bendict Equation
BMR * metric (little to no exercise 1.2; light exercise 1-3 days 1.375; moderate exercise 3-5 days week 1.55; heavy exercise 6-7 days 1.725; very heavy exercise twice per day 1.9)
Current HBE: 2089 * 1.2 = 2506.8
Planned HBE:  2089 * 1.55 = 3237.95
In order to loose a pound a week I should eat no more than 2500 calories a day

If you want to loose a pound a week, you need to have a deficit of 3500 calories for the week; that means 500/day
I need to consume btw 2237 - 2737 calories to ensure weight loss
Day 1: July 3, 2017; 184th day in the year
35 weeks (245 days)
429th day which would be the 64th day of 2018
End Date: My goal is March 5, 2018 to be 78-80lbs
Motivation
Don't reward yourself too early, wait until you've earned it.  DOn't buy those shoes, or exercise equpipment before you've earned it.
Get a partner.
Remove judgement from your life by planning things far in advance.  Know exactly what you need to do each day.
