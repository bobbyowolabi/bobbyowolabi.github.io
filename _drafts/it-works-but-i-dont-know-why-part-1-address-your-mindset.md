## Address Your Mindest

The answer to the following question will not only have a big impact on your level of enjoyment and happiness as a software engineer, but it will have a large influence in many aspects of your life.

> How do you feel when you don't understand something?

This seems like a simple question, but the answer is very telling.  What if this feeling continues for days, weeks or even a year?  Do you tend to feel "down" or get discouraged?  Or do you feel curious?  Are you energized?

The way that one feels when encountering things they don't understand may be in correlation to their mindset.  If you do find yourself discouraged in these types of situations, know that this is a choice you don't have to make!  If you are getting down, consider altering your mindset.

### Growth Mindset
(TODO: Talk about growth mindset)

_Describe the Growth Mindset Study That Was done on children._

#### Controversey
Talk about some of the controversey around the theory but that anecdoteally that it has proved to be helpful.

### Reasons to Address Your Mindset

#### It's Not Always User Error
Some code may just not be well written.  I have been in situations when I've felt self-concious for not understanding how something is working only to realize in the end that it was not well-written code.

#### It Doesn't Look As Bad As You Think (Deal With Imposter Syndrome)
If you are in a healthy organization with good hiring processes, than there is a reason they hired you.

#### You Are Learning Someone Else Mental Model
Be kind to yourself.  It's important to put any problem at hand in its proper perspective.  When you are learning new code, what you are really doing is learning someone else's mental model of the problem they attempted solve.  The best solutions  Sometimes a mental model may come easy to you.  Other times it may not, be kind to yourself as you learn the model.

### Conclusion
It's very important to separate how you feel about yourself and life from your performance <sup>[[a]](#eloquent-javascript-note)</sup>.  If you don't do this, you'll find that your mood will swing by the day or even hour depending on how quickly you are able to perform your tasks.  Be kind to yourself, it's just not a nice way to live when you make your perforamnce a reflection on yourself.

Have the mindset that I am going to grow no matter what and you truly will.

### Notes
[<a name="eloquent-javascript-note">a</a>] I like the advice that Haverbeke gives to his readers in the introduction of his text on programming.
> "It is up to you to make the necessary effort. When you are struggling to follow the book, do not jump to any conclusions about your own capabilities. You are fine—you just need to keep at it. Take a break, reread some material, and always make sure you read and understand the example programs and exercises. Learning is hard work, but everything you learn is yours and will make subsequent learning easier." <sup>[[5]](#eloquent-javascript-quote)</sup>
