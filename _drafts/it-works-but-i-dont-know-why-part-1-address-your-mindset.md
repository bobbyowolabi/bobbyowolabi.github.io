### Address Your Mindest
_(Growth Mindset)_

Being in this zone can be unpleasant and can mess with your morale ... but it doesn't have to.  The first thing you should do if you are getting down is to change your mindset.

(TODO: Talk about growth mindset)

Have the mindset that I am going to grow no matter what.


its important to separate how you feel about yourself and life from your performance.  you'll be up and down.
