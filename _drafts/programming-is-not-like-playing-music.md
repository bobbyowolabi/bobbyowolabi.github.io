title: Programming Is Not Like Playing Music
description: A lot of times people like to make the case that programming is similar to creating music.  In this post I make the case that programing is not like playing music by stating a short, simple and basic truth ...

Over the years I’ve come across various blog posts and articles stating that creating music is very similar to writing software.  They describe the creative process that fuels both fields.  They point to the number of musicians that have functioned successfully as software engineers.  This is all true, but there is one fundamental difference that separates music from programming …

Another way to put it is that since music performance is in real-time, once someone plays a note, it can’t be taken back, altered or fixed.  Simple, yes.  But this one fact is what separates performance based fields (such as music, sports, dance, theater, etc.) from other fields.  This is what drives musicians to repeatedly practice scales and exercises they way they do.  It’s what drives a basketball player to practice countless jump shots.  In the moment of performance, competition, etc. you must be able to execute exactly what you want to express.

**Programming is different … we have a delete key**.  

> You named a “routine” <sup>[[2]](#thought-on-routine)</sup> in your program and realize that there is a much better name … **Delete** and rename!

> You are singing your nation’s anthem and are unable to hit the notes of the most memorable section … Hope your audience is kind!

Change is so ingrained in the process of programming that even our IDEs supply us with tools to automate refactoring.  When performing music, you just don’t have that luxury.  

### Muscle Memory
Not only does a musician want to be able to execute precisely what they want to express in real-time, but they also do not want to be inhibited by mental activity.  

One activity many people do that illustrates this is driving a car.  When you first are learning to drive a car you are focusing on hitting the brake and gas pedals smoothly and at the right time.  You are reminding yourself to look in your rear and side mirrors to be alert.  You likely are not able to do additional tasks while driving.  However, after sometime, driving becomes second nature.  You can 

Our bodies have adopted to this need through something called muscle memory.

<a name=”coughlin-lesson”>[1]</a> I learned this lesson from [Dr. Kyle Coughlin][kyle-coughlin].

<a name=”thoughts-on-routine”>[2]</a> I was going to use the term function or method but wondered if I should use a more general term.  I decided to try routine and read through this [stackoverflow answer on it][stackoverflow-routine].
