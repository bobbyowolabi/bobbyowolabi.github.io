How Do I Create a Sine Wave Sound?


Oscillators
Often times we find ourselves processing recorded sound, but it is possible to produce tones .
"Instead of taking some existing sound signal, you can also pull sounds out of thin air by synthesizing them using OscillatorNodes.
You can use oscillators to make continuous sine, square, sawtooth, triangle and custom-shaped waves." (pero-web-audio-part-0)
