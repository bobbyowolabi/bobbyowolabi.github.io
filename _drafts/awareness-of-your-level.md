My theory is that it depends on your status within the given team or situation. I'd like to use a metaphor to clarify. In the NBA, there is a common framework used to score players skill and contribution level to a team and the leak. People ask the question is a player a role player? A starter? And all star? A superstar? Describe the meaning of all of these terms.  My theory is that people who are strong starters and above probably are going to establish this by default. Whereas weaker starters and role players might have to be more intentional about this. These rankings or scorings need to be taken in context. A role player in the NBA is one of the best players in the world. And I think a good parallel is taking a strong tech hub such as silicon valley. It's no small feat to be a solid role player in silicon valley. Also I should note that there aren't teams that are solely built with superstars or All Stars etc. It takes a healthy mix of people at all levels to make a successful winning team. And that is the same in tech.

awareness is always great and knowing where you are in your given League is important.

Following up on my idea that there are some engineers that seem to do this naturally I think a good analogy would be that if you are a starter, and all star or Superstar you probably already have your stuff together to do this naturally. Your talent won't be questioned but if you are a role player you have to do this and I think that is probably has been my mistake. Being a role player and not making a conscious effort to establish myself.

If I'm making a analogy here is that sometimes role players or you know players that are good enough to make it to the league oftentimes they can become great at other things like coaching or great executives or fill in the blank and I think that is where I am in my career I am a role player and I'm trying to figure out what to do next and what can make me stand out.
