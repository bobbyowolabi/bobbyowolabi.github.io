title: On Channeling Your Inner Genius
description: This is my first blog post!  In this post, I use Sam Newsome's concept of one's "Inner Genius" to facilitate motivation for this blog and give praise for various "inner geniuses" I have observed.  Hopefully this will encourage others and myself in the process.

Often times a barrier to starting a blog, or any public undertaking, is the thinking that one has nothing to say.  Or rather, ‘what I have to say isn’t deep enough.’  The truth of the matter is that we all have strengths; we tend to trivialize and take them for granted.

Sam Newsome, a soprano saxophonist [[0]](#0), describes these strengths as our natural genius zone [[1]](#1).  As he puts it:

> “This is an ability to do or understand something that you seem to be able to do better than most--that thing which feels very natural. Simply put, this is an ability that seems too easy.” [[1]](#1)

We all have a natural genius zone.

Though Newsome describes this from the context of musical exploration, I feel it has wide applicability.  

I think of Robert C. Martin’s deep sense of computer science knowledge and history.  In a recent post [4], he explores the question “Is the training of a neural net a kind of programming?”  His self reflection was prompted by a question Grady Booch [6] posed about “how the presence of neural networks impact the dev lifecycle” [cite] (in light of an article illustrating how difficult they seem to formalize and get a handle on).  Martin first approaches the problem with the implied premise that development cycles (planning, estimating, developing, etc) are implemented around programming software.  If the training of a neural network is a type of programming, then that could provide some insight into how it impacts or is even applicable to the dev cycle.  Martin goes on to cite Alan Turing’s 1936 paper [5] to establish the definition of computer programming [7].  He then draws a parallel [10] between Turing’s definition and Dijkstra’s “language of Sequence, Selection, and Iteration” of which he was a proponent of in a famous paper in 1968 [9]

I was struck at how Martin naturally cited materials and concepts from the 1930s and 1960s.  His knack for reaching to the past to put things in their proper context is something I’ve observed in his writing and is not so common in my opinion.  Being well versed in computer science foundational knowledge & history … genius zone.

I think of Hakim El Hattab and his fantastic collection of front-end projects and demos.  [http://hakim.se/].  The way he presents his portfolio on his site is really great.  The fact that his demos have been served to hundreds of millions of visitors means that I’m not the only one who thinks so [11].  His output is the result of hard work not just talent [12] One of his projects, reveal.js [http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/] turned out to be the foundation of his now full-time venture [https://slides.com/].  Pushing the envelop of what can be accomplished in front-end development and presenting great experimental demos … genius zone.

I think of Makinde Adeagbo​ [http://makinde.adeagbo.com/], founder of /dev/color [https://www.devcolor.org/], formerly of facebook, pinterest and dropbox.  /dev/color is a non profit organization whose mission is to support black engineers in the software industry.  It was accepted into Y Combinator, a competitive, influential startup incubator in Silicon Valley, which is a big deal.  When you are a respected engineer in silicon valley (showing up in a code.org video with Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and will.i.am) but you expend your energy working on a problem of social importance and urgency in the tech industry … genius zone.

I think of Ge Wang [http://www.gewang.com/], professor at Stanford University.  While at Duke University, he considered studying music but his father encouraged him to do something more practical3.  He studied computer science and took as many music courses as he could3.  Once he figured out how to merge his two interests[cite], the rest was history. He studied at Princeton and created a programming language, ChucK, designed for the creation of sound for his dissertation[link].  He co-founded a successful start up smule [https://www.smule.com/] and amongst many, many things, cleverly turned the the iPhone into an actual actual flutes of sorts through an app Ocarina, that utilized its microphone and accelerometer.  He started an innovative experimental performance group the laptop orchestra.  Successfully combining his interests of music and computer science into a very successful career … genius zone.

Newsome explains an irony of operating in one’s genius zone in that since we operate from this state with such ease, we can be deceived into thinking that what we produce from this space has no merit.  

That’s why comparing ourselves to others can be detrimental.  When we observe others operating from their genius zone, we should choose to react positively with admiration,  motivation and curiosity rather than intimidation and self-doubt.  We are all created uniquely and that is something to embrace.

This brings me to precisely the purpose of this site … to realize and explore my own genius zone.

[<a name="0">0</a>] Sam Newsome is an exclusive soprano saxophonist.  Most woodwind players have a “main instrument” for example the alto or tenor saxophone and play the soprano sax on the side.  It isn’t common for a musician to solely play the soprano sax.  Sam Newsome made that decision on <fill in the blank] date.
