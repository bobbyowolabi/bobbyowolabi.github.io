Do you know that feeling when you get a piece of software to work and you have no idea why it did? Or just as uneasy of a feeling, when you can't get a piece of software to work and you don't know the first question to ask yourself or a colleague?

Often times we associate these types of experiences with beginners.  I was once there.  I remember some instances in undergrad where I submitted programming assignments that passed all the required tests.  This is a great feeling, trust me!  But if I took a step back and were honest, there were instances where I wouldn't have been able to tell you exactly why.  These types of experiences are not just limited to beginners.  A seasoned engineer can also find him or herself in this situation especially when learning a new architecture.

> How Do You Identify It?

For me, I get this feeling that I tend to describe and use sentiments such as not being able to "touch it", "reason or play with it"

> Why Does This Happen?

I was reading an interview of Paul Bucheit and the light bulb went off for me after his answer to the question _**"What skills and knowledge does it take to be a good engineer?"**_ (TODO: cite) He stated that the best engineers understand abstractions at every level from the chip to protocols and systems.

It then hit me why we have the experiences of not understanding why or why not something worked ... It is because there is some abstraction in your environment / framework / architecture etc. that you don't understand sufficiently (key word sufficiently, more on that later)  That's why you can't begin to reason on it because there are too many holes in your foundation to stand on.

> What Can We Do About It?

I don't have the magic answer as I currently find myself in this situation, but the following are encouraging insights and techniques to get out of the rut.

### Address Your Mindest
_(Growth Mindset)_

Being in this zone can be unpleasant and can mess with your morale ... but it doesn't have to.  The first thing you should do if you are getting down is to change your mindset.

(TODO: Talk about growth mindset)

Have the mindset that I am going to grow no matter what.

### Acknowledge That The Problem Is Large
_(Be Like Bill Evans)_

tldr; Successful people know that the problem is large and take it one step at a time.

### Accept That You Might Not Understand Everything
_(Listen to Steve Wilson)_

(TODO: Dig up the interview and get quotation)

Do you need to understand each and every abtraction?  No.  And this is where I slightly diverge from Buchheit.  I use an anology of a common debate in the NBA corners to explain.

Elite players in the NBA are often put into two groups, allstars and superstars.  An allstar is exactly how it sounds, someone who makes the Allstar and is generally considered an excellent player.  However, there is another higher level

Abstractions and their interfaces are made to make our lives easier.  That's why we are able to try a car and not have to understand all of the various reactions, processes and engineering that occur to make it possible.

### Be Open & Learn From Many Teachers
_(Be Like Gary Bartz)_
A teacher does not have to be a person, a book, a YoutTube viedo, a Blog, etc.

### Develop Your Own Mental Model

#### Write Down Your Questions Even If They Don't Make Sense
Start writing down your questions even if they don't make sense.  A wrong question can point out a weakness.  You can even use this as a launching pad when asking for help.  "This question may not make sense but I think it could reveal an assumption that I have wrong"

### Don't Be So Serious - Make it Fun!
_(Take a Page From the Bulletproof Musician Technique)_
It's a game, think of it as a puzzle and that you are a detective.  This is a practice technique, from bulletproof musician that I leanred while studying at HCC.

Make it fun, make it a game or a challenge, be like a scientist.
