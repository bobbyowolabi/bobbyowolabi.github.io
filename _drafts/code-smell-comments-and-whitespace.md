description: In this post, I write about how learning to favor refactoring over the usage of whitespace & comments has greatly improved my craft.  I use an example of how I leanred something in music that transformed my craft in a siimilar way.

Sometimes there is a lesson, exercise or some concept that you learn that just catapults your development forward.  It could be a small thing … something not so obviously influential; but once you absorb it, your craft just moves forward.

I had such an experience practicing the saxophone.  I started out playing the saxophone in fourth grade [[1]](#note-1) and continued through high school.  I had no formal plans on how I would continue playing after high school so the summer after I graduated I asked my mother if I could get lessons [[2]](#2-note).  She set up four lessons with an instrumental music teacher in my local school system.  I met with Mr. Fogleman in his home and we went over many things, much of which I do not remember.  I do remember him showing me the software [Band-in-a-Box][band-in-a-box].  It can generate a musical rendition of virtually any chord progression of popular music [[3]](#3-citation).  Musicians play along with the computer generated accompaniment to practice.  I thought it was cool.   

But there was one lesson that really stood out [[4]](#4-note).  Mr. Fogleman took me to a piano and asked me to only bring my [mouthpiece][mouthpiece].  He proceeded to play his mouthpiece, that is, to make a buzzing sound on it (sorta like a duck call).  He would play a note on the piano and then play the same note on his mouthpiece.  He did this for many notes.  When I attempted to play my mouthpiece, I could only play one note, I couldn’t work my mouthpiece to play a variety of notes like my teacher could.  I went home and over the course of the next week I worked on this exercise often.  By the end of the week, I could play a full [chromatic scale][chromatic-scale] on the piano and match each note on my mouthpiece.  The next time I met with Mr. Fogleman, he noted that my sound on the saxophone changed.  He was impressed and told me to continue practicing it.  I could hear the change as well, my tone was more “professional” [[5]](#5-note). 

So what happened?  Was there something magical about making buzzing sounds with my mouthpiece and matching notes played at the piano?  Not exactly.  What Mr. Fogleman taught me through this exercise was how to improve and loosen my [embouchure][embouchure].  It difficult to play different notes onis not possible to play different notes on a

[<a name=”5-note”>5</a>] I continued playing on and off through my adult years.  Whenever I received compliment, it was never, “you have good chops”, or anything about my technical proficiency / musical ideas.  It was always “you have a really good tone”.  What Mr. Fogleman showed me that day is to thank for that.  When I would receive this compliment, I used to feel bad.  I always felt like I got this compliment because I was so deficient in the other areas of my playing and I hadn’t put in the necessary time.  But hey, I can still

There are always exceptions to rule, but generally following guidelines  I came this principle and it changed the way I code.  Sometimes there are lessons in life or in aqcuiring a craft that are paradigm changing. <Write about embrasure adjustment from Robert Fogleman> Write about how I used to secretly go back and admire code I’d written.  I always tried to use the least amount of code possible that still was readable. Describe how I use to code and use comments. W Code Smells: Whitespace & Comments Yegor - his post that put me on to this Robert Martin - the boy scout rule There was a recent post I came across where Martin concedes this is not always possiblehttp://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/02/23/NecessaryComments.html
