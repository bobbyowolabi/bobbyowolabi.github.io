Whenever you join a new industry, company, team, etc ... You must do the following ... 

> You must show everyone what you do well and create a "name" / niche for yourself.

This applies to everyone.  If there is an exception to this, I would say that depending on one's skill level and relative competiveness of the environment they are joining, it may be the case that one will demonstrate this requirement organically without explicit focus.  Nevertheless, everyone who establishes themselves and becomes successful in a given environment does this regardless of if they are actively thinking about it.

If you fail to fulfil this requirement, it will be unpleasant for you and those around you.

When you're doing something new (i.e. joining a new industry, company, team, etc.) you're likely going to need time to get good at it.  While you are ramping up and getting good in the new environment, you still need to contribute.  How does one manage this balance?

The key is ...
> People will excuse your weaknesses and shortcomings if they can clearly see the value that you bring. 

You can ask a million questions when you've established yourself in the new environment.  Your peers will be motivated and pleased by your enthusiasm because they know that the investment will pay off in the future by your contributions. But when you haven't established yourself, your million questions will not be appreciated.  It will feel like a burden to your peers.  It will be like an investment they have to make where they know there will not be any returns.

When you fail to establish yourself people will write a narrative for you ... more often than not, this narrative will be a negative one.

> Don't allow people to write your narrative.

When you were accepted into the new environment, you demonstrated something that you have qualities that will contribute to the environment's bottom line.  Make sure that you remind everyone of these qualities by explicitly showing your value and strengths as soon as you can.

In the situations there wasn't anyone around to pull me aside and tell me what was going on. I had to learn for myself.

### Examples of Demonstrating Your Strengths & Creating a Name For Yourself

#### Chris Botti
When Chris body was in New York went in really was killing it at the same time and body knew that he had to do something different because he couldn't do what Winton was doing better than him.

#### Jay Z
Or when Jay z was touring with DMX and saw how great he was doing during his sets he had to figure out how he could shine because he couldn't do what DMX was doing better than him.

### On the Power of Perception
On the power of perception and your career. This is another title that could go well with this post.
