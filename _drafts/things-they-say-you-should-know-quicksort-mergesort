In his book, “The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers", Robert Martin makes the claim that one must know their field.  He asks the reader if they are familiar with various concepts in computer science including:
"Could you write a quicksort without looking it up?" [1]
He then asks “If not … why not?” He implores the reader to continually fill the size of the chunk that they know about our field.
