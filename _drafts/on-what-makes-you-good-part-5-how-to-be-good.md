Having connections in itself isn't enough.  Be good.
Dr. Coughlin said there are three things when loooking for someone to play with:
# Reliable, On Time
# Proficient & Skilled
# Pleasant to WOrk With (Not a jerk)
Having at least 2 of the 3 makes the person viable.  In software, replace being Being Good with writing clean resuable code, Being Pleasant 
If you are looking for a startup - maybe clean reusable code isn't necessary, you need a hacker.
