[The requirement][the-requirement] is 

> You must actively demonstrate your [strengths](#strengths) <sup>[[a]](#strengths)</sup> as soon as possible.

This might seem counterintuitive and you may be tempted to think that you must work on your weaknesses, 

For our purposes, a strength is merely [something that you are naturally good at][genius-zone]; it does not have to be overly complicated for it to be useful in an environment.  Here are some examples of strengths:

**Documentation Wiz**

This is the person on the team that is great at taking the initiative to update the documentation of your products.  This individual can join a team and quickly make contributions to the documentation as they learn new things and ramp up.  They can help decrease the amount of inbounds requests that the team receives by making the documentation stronger.  Teammates will notice and appreciate this.

**"This Does Not Make Sense" Alerter**

Every team needs a person who is not afraid to call out when something does not make sense. Sometimes when a group of people are working on a task there may be things that are not clear to anyone but no one is willing to call it out and address the ambiguity. The person who has this "sixth sense" will help the team be focused, build morale and improve productvity.

**The Framework Layer**

 This is the person on the team who is able to see the areas that need improvement in the day-to-day tasks of the team members. This person takes the initiative to automate, build libraries, tools and Frameworks to make the various tasks of the teammates better. Some organizations have teams dedicated to this purpose; however, it is great to have a framework minded person on the team to do the nitty-gritty work that needs to be done but often is not prioritized.

**Ticket a Day Guru**

 This is the "assassin" that is able to complete a feature request or bug fix in a day. They are able to just get stuff done quickly and efficiently. This person is an all star that helps push the team's productivity forward.

**Test Accountability Chief**

Often times individuals cut corners when it comes to testing. Certain features or capabilities can be hard or not currently possible to test.  This individual will advocate for components to be well-tested and advocate to prioritize the tasks that need to be completed to accomplish this.  This makes the overall confidence in the team's work stronger, thus building morale.

**The Architect**

This individual knows how to design systems fast and efficiently. They are able to a prototype and get a working artifact up and running as a proof-of-concept. This individual pushes the team's productivity forward.

**The Social Influencer**

This individual wears many hats. They make sure that everyone's birthday, milestones and work anniversaries are acknowledged.  They organize card signings, plan social and team building activities ... they make the team a pleasant environment to be in.  Their thoughtfulness builds team morale and cohesion.

**The Organizer**

Every team needs someone who can create a road map for the team to execute on  … consolidate the details of a discussion into a document that can be visualized and shared for further evaluation … ensure that designs and tasks are well fleshed out in the team’s ticketing system … meet with team members to understand they current work and challenges and translate these insights into action items … meet with partner teams and customers to understand inbounds requests.  This individual is a leader that the team will appreciate.

**The Visionary**

This individual is always thinking about the future. They Want to make sure that the team's vision is clear and in lineman with their current work. Sometimes this means deprecating or retiring certain products …  sometimes this means interviewing customers and thinking about future products or features that's a steal their needs not necessarily their exact implementation Solutions.  Planning is necessary and common, but strategic planning is not always prioritized.  This individual can help ensure the relevance of your team in your organization.
