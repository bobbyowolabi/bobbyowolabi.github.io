## Composing Music on Paper and Computers
<br/>	
### Abstract
Paper is preferred and utilized far more than computers in the composer's music creation cycle because it is the natural medium in which music notation convention is learned. Current music notation software utilizes only WIMP interfaces (Windows, Icon, Menus and point and click). Our system enables users to create musical compositions by utilizing digital pen technology and having their work captured and recognized into music notation in the digital world. This recognized pen gesture data has the potential of being imported into a popular musical notation composition program for editing purposes.
