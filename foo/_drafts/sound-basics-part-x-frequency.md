## Frequency
We often describe sounds as being high (Flute) or low (Tuba).  Does the pattern of varying amplitudes repeat?  If so, we are in the realm of frequency.  Frequency is how quickly does the pattern of varying pressures repeat?  (music-and-computers)

Frequency - the number of cycles per second.  It is measured in Hertz (Hz)

Weâ€™ll talk more about the ear later in our exploration, but it is these characteristics of a soundwave that our ears take as input to produce sound for us [kalenzaga-shazam].  Human ears can hear pure tones from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz [kalenzaga-shazam].

Pitch and Frequency are not the same thing.
