## Google Analytics
I use a tool called Google Analytics to analyze how visitors interact with this site.  It is a very popular tool that is used on many websites.

### What is Reported?
It reports information about the visitor such as:
* How often they visit the site
* The pages they visit 
* The site that provided a link to this site (If applicable)
* And various other tidbits

It should be noted that no personally identifiable information is included in the reporting, but rather your [IP address][ip-address].

This information is reported to Google and allows me to view insights about the traffic coming to this site.  I'm especially interested in how many people are visiting the site.

To get more detailed information, please take a look at [Google Analytic's Terms of Service][google-tos].

#### Cookies
Google Analytics uses cookies.  ["A cookie is a small piece of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. It helps the website to remember information about your visit."][1] 

#### Opting Out
If you prefer not to allow cookies, here are a couple of options:
* [Disable cookies in your browser][2]
