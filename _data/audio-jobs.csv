Job Overview 		Qualcomm is a pioneering designer and developer of silicon and software for the consumer electronics market and a global leader in wireless technology.

This requisition is for a position within the Internet of Things business unit that focuses on accessories based on Bluetooth like headsets and sound bars. The same technology is used for automotive infotainment systems.

The chips used in the accessory market contain a few tiny 8-bits and 16-bits processors and small 24-bits and 32-bits DSP that run a bespoke real-time operating system. The chips used in the automotive market also use large ARM core.

The audio group in Cambridge (United Kingdom) focuses firstly on the development of the framework used by the DSP and secondly on integration of work done all over the world.

It stands between teams in charge of the design, implementation and test of algorithms, and teams in charge of chip specific development.

Most of the software for the framework is written in C while the audio algorithm are written in assembly.

In many products, the software goes directly into ROM and not flash so a conservative approach is required.

The team maintains its own collection of tools mostly written in Python.

Engineers work on both Windows and Linux, simulators, emulators and silicon.

The projects tasks are usually split among small, mostly autonomous teams of specialists.

Individual engineers mostly interact directly with their peers inside and outside the team using a wide collection of tools (phone, email, instant messaging, wiki, revision control, bug tracker...).

While interactions with upper management are usually left to the project lead, it is expected for engineers at this level to be able to coach junior engineer and new hires.

Qualcomm offers a broad benefits package including a competitive annual salary, performance bonus, an employee share purchase program, generous pension scheme, private medical and 25 days annual leave. You will also be eligible for subsidized gym membership, season ticket loan as well as subsidized lunches in our onsite canteen.

    We run experiments: we make systematic decisions, we measure outcomes to see what works, and we learn from our experience.
    We have lots of perks and quirks: daily push-up sessions, bonus for sport activities, jam sessions (with more instruments than you can shake a drumstick at!), board game tournaments and sauna evenings, and our famous Greece, Thailand and Tenerife work-retreats.

HOW TO APPLY:

    Send us your application and CV (in English). Let's make the world a more musical place together! Everyone who comes to a personal interview at our office gets an ukulele. #rockon
