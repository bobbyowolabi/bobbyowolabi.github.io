Mixer is the newest addition to the Xbox family.   At Mixer we’ve redefined the rules for what constitutes live streaming.   We don’t talk about delay in terms of seconds, in our world we operate in milliseconds.   With an end to end delay as low as 250 milliseconds, we’re able to do things never thought possible to make the viewer experience far more engaging and interactive.   From the obvious; seeing a streamer respond to a chat message instantly, to the exciting; allowing a viewer to interact directly with the game the streamer is playing, we’ve made the viewers part of the action and we’re not stopping there!     





Mixer is looking for an engineer to join our video team.   We are looking for people with deep domain knowledge in low latency media delivery including NAT traversal, capability negotiation and the transport of the audio and video streams.   





Basic Qualifications: 


• 3+ years of professional development experience 


• Experience in (one of) C/C++/C#





Preferred Qualifications:


• Experience with low latency media connection handshakes and transport (SIP, STUN/TURN/ICE, DTLS, WebRTC, RTP, H.264, OPUS)


• Experience developing highly reliable and scalable micro services   





Nice to have:   


• Experience developing and debugging services in Linux 


• Experience working with RTMP and HLS 


• Strong desire to work with streamers and viewers to troubleshoot issues   


• Experience working in a dynamic startup environment
