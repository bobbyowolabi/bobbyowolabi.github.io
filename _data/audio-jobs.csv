"2017/07/26 9:05:52 PM AST","Audio Programmer","","Media Molecule Ltd","Guildford, UK","_ We regret to inform that we cannot sponsor work visas at this time. _

We are searching for an Audio Programmer to join our close-knit team and contribute their skills and creativity towards creating Dreams, our latest UGC project.
This is not the most typical audio programming role. The successful applicant will develop all aspects of the game’s audio stack, from creating software instruments to designing and implementing the musical UI/UX.
We are not simply looking for a programmer who happens to do some audio. We’re looking for an exceptional individual with a real jones for the potential of audio and music creation in interactive entertainment.
A core part of our game Dreams is a powerful musical instrument, which can also be used for sound design.  It’s fun to play with, but also has depth. We want you to help us make it even better – for professionals, hobbyists and anyone in the PlayStation Games audience who wants to express themselves creatively.
Requirements
A keen interest in, and understanding of, sound and music for games.
An eye and an ear for what makes a great musical instrument, and the skills to code it. This role has a design/UX element to it.
Low-level coder with DSP and audio code skills. You will be working on a unique sound engine, which includes sound creation and mangling features.
Self-motivated – can create great user experiences without having to rely completely on feedback in order to iterate and make progress.
Evidence of something relevant you have made – a game, graduation project, audio plugin, musical experiment, toy, user interface, etc.
Please note that we will request a show-reel or link to past work if not included in your application.

Fuze allows the modern, mobile workforce to seamlessly communicate anytime, anywhere, across any device.
Customers use our software across a variety of platforms including iOS, Android, Windows, OS X and the web.  As a member of the Real-Time Communications team you will help build the heart of our product, the software stacks that power the audio and video communications for the platform.  You will work across both the client and backend stacks.  We believe strongly in modularity and code reuse.  
To ensure our customers have the best experience, these microservices are built with scalability, resiliency and performance in mind.  The things that you will build at Fuze impact the success of our customers and of the company.
What you'll do:
As a member of the Real-Time Communications team, you will build Linux-based microservices to provide audio, video, screen share, content, recording and interoperability gateway functions.
You will develop using open source technologies like WebRTC and where it makes sense, build custom software.
You will design the microservices using a combination of REST APIs and IETF standards based protocols to provide functionality to our desktop, mobile and web-based clients.
You will develop cross platform code -- sharing code across clients and sometimes between the clients and various backend services.  
As you’re developing cross platform code that is often CPU intensive and performance critical, you will use C++ for code that requires portability between the clients and servers. For backend service, whenever that is not a concern, you will standardize on Go.
You will work with senior members of the team to develop key components of the client media framework and backend services.  
You will be responsible for identifying and implementing innovative solutions to difficult problems.
You will learn and deliver at a fast pace.  
You will quickly move on to bigger and more challenging problems and will take over ownership of components in our solution.
