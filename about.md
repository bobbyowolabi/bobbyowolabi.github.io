## About
<br/>

Hello, my name is Bobby Owolabi.  I’m a software engineer experienced in dataflow, data modeling and Java enterprise solutions with a growing interest in audio software engineering.  

Audio is often a crucial component of software these days; however, its implementations and corresponding profession seem to be a black box to many.  It’s my aim to bring clarity of this field to myself and others.


*I blog at the intersection of audio, coding & music.*
