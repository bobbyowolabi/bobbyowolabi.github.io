## About
<br/>

Hello, my name is Bobby Owolabi.  I’m a software engineer in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area interested in the area of audio programming.  This likely stems from my love of music.  

Audio is often a crucial component of software these days; however, its implementations and corresponding profession seem to be a black box to many.  It’s my aim to bring clarity of this field to myself and others.


*I blog at the intersection of audio, coding & music.*
